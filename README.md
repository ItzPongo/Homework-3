# Homework-3
In order to run the code of the tcp-variants-comparison.cc, it requires the uses of the command line to set up the inforation in a specific way. For part 1 of the assignment, the information is to be put together on the command line after ssh into the server and going to the correct folder of NS-3, and inputting ./ns3 run tcp-variants-comparison --command-template="%s --tracing=1 --prefix_name=[input name] --tcpVariant1=[insert correct variant]"

for part 2 it is similar, but add --tcpVariant2=[insert correct variant] inside the quotation marks
