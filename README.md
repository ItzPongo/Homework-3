# Homework-3
In order to run the code of the tcp-variants-comparison.cc, it requires the uses of the command line to set up the inforation in a specific way. For part 1 of the assignment, the information is to be put together on the command line after ssh into the server and going to the correct folder of NS-3, and inputting ./ns3 run tcp-variants-comparison --command-template="%s --tracing=1 --prefix_name=[input name] --tcpVariant1=[insert correct variant]"

for part 2 it is similar, but add --tcpVariant2=[insert correct variant] inside the quotation marks


# Questions
TCP variants do not necessarily share bandwidth fairly due to differences in their congestion control algorithms. New Reno relies on fast retransmission and a modified congestion control mechanism to recover from packet losses but may underutilize available bandwidth in high-latency environments. TCP Vegas proactively estimates available bandwidth and adjusts its transmission rate, which can lead to fair sharing but may not perform optimally in highly lossy conditions. TCP Cubic, designed for high-bandwidth, high-latency networks, uses a cubic function to increase its congestion window more aggressively after packet loss, making it suitable for such environments. Therefore, for a lossy, high-latency link (~100ms RTT or more), TCP Cubic would be the preferred choice due to its ability to maximize throughput while adapting well to network conditions.

#part 1 trends
TCP New Reno: New Reno primarily employs a loss-based congestion control mechanism. When it detects packet loss (typically through timeouts or triple duplicate acknowledgments), it reduces the cwnd significantly, often halving it. After recovery, cwnd increases gradually during the congestion avoidance phase, typically using additive increase. This results in a sawtooth pattern in cwnd dynamics, characterized by sharp drops during loss events and slow growth during stable periods.

TCP Vegas: Vegas takes a more proactive approach by estimating the available bandwidth and adjusting cwnd accordingly. It monitors round-trip time (RTT) and compares it with a baseline to detect potential congestion before packet loss occurs. This leads to a more gradual and smooth increase in cwnd. In stable conditions, Vegas tends to maintain a higher cwnd compared to New Reno, as it avoids aggressive increases that could lead to loss. Its dynamics reflect more gentle oscillations, with adjustments that prevent congestion rather than reacting to it.

TCP Cubic: Cubic is designed for high-bandwidth, high-latency environments and employs a cubic function to control cwnd growth. After a loss event, Cubic reduces cwnd sharply, but the recovery phase sees a rapid increase based on a cubic curve, allowing it to quickly utilize available bandwidth. This results in a more aggressive cwnd growth compared to New Reno and Vegas, especially after a recovery from loss. Cubicâ€™s dynamics exhibit large fluctuations but are generally more efficient in utilizing available network capacity.
